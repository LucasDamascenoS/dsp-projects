# Spoken digits processing with deep learning

DSP and machine learning for studying deep learning applied to isolated word (digits from 0 to 9) recognition.

# Basic information about the project

Forked from https://github.com/sklautau/whistled-speech-analysis

Auxiliary software: Praat (https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) and dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lazyrac00n/speech-activity-detection-datasets?resource=download

Language: Python 3

# Dependency

## System

* Python >= 3.9.0
* pip >= 21.2.4
* conda >= 4.12.0

## Libraries
* numpy==1.22.4

## Getting started

After cloning the project to a folder that we will call "root" here, create a folder "wav" in "root", with the waveform files. 

We will assume the dataset FSSD (https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset). After obtaining it, copy the files in its folder "recordings" to root\wav.

Then, from "root" folder, execute:

python execute_all.py
