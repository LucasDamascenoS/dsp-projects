# Extraction of instantaneous frequencies using Synchrosqueezing in Python

The project main goal is to use the Synchrosqueezing method to analyse and extract instantaneous frequencies of signals that have variable frequencies over time.

# Installation

Run setup.py to install the libraries and the test dataset.

# Executing / performing basic analysis

- The "ridge_generated_signals_ssq.py" script runs ridge extraction for a generated signal based in a sum of three senoids with defined frequencies. 
- The "ridge_visualization_only.py" 
- The "ridge_with_ground_truth.py"
