# MIDI-DDSP: Detailed Control of Musical Performance via Hierarchical Modeling

Implement a hierarchical generative model of musical performance to
provide both realism and control. Similar to conventional synthesizers and samplers
that use the MIDI standard, MIDI-DDSP converts note timing, pitch, and
expression information into fine-grained parameter control of DDSP synthesizer modules.
The hierarchical structure underlying the process of creating music involves a
composer writing a piece as a series of notes. A performer interprets these notes through a myriad of
nuanced, sub-second choices about articulation, dynamics, and expression. These expressive gestures are realized as audio through the short-time pitch and timbre changes of the physical vibration
of the instrument. MIDI-DDSP is built on a similar 3-level hierarchy (notes, performance, synthesis)
with interpretable representations at each level.
